<h1>So, about Alex...</h1>
Hi! Like it says on the homepage, I'm a curious person; 
it's the trait I'm most proud of and it's what led me to pursue a career 
in analytics. Turning raw data into a story that helps people make 
informed decisions gets me excited (and kind of makes me feel like a 
magician... kind of). My background in education and mindfulness inform 
my people-centered approach to making data insights work for everyone.<br /><br />
 
After six rewarding years of teaching, I decided to leave the classroom 
for a new challege and started learning the tools needed for the data
analysis process through Udacity. Some of my projects will be uploaded
on this site soon, so be sure to check back. I believe analytics, data 
science, and machine/deep learning have the potential to dramatically 
elevate the human condition, and that they might lead to an explosion of 
human achievement over the next century. I want to be a part of that.<br /><br />

I honed important skills at the whiteboard and in parent-teacher 
conferences: I'm incredibly adaptable, I value multiple perspectives, 
I embrace conflict as the rich opportunity for growth that it is, 
I love learning and am confident in my ability to do so, I'm great at 
building and maintaining relationships, I'm a highly capable mathematician, 
collaboration and connection come second-nature to me, and since 
everything seems urgent in a school setting, my organization and 
prioritization abilities are solid. My colleagues would say I'm fun to 
have around the office, too.<br /><br />

I'll bring that entire toolkit to my next position, and am
currently looking for a position as a data analyst. My time in education
made clear the need for targeted analysis with the goal of effecting 
system-wide positive change. I want to collaborate with people dedicated 
to achieving this in their organization, their community, and the world 
at large, supporting them with data insights so they can do so 
efficiently.<br /><br />

Please be in touch if you're looking for someone like me, and thank 
you for visiting!<br />
