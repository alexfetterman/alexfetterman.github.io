Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered 
by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a 
lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I'll be using this site to document my deep dive
into the world of data... from analytics to deep learning. Thank you Jonathan McGlone!
