title: "Unclean Data I: Introduction"

When working with a new dataset, the first task at hand is to get
familiar with it. Think of it like scoping out a house to buy; you want
to know the square footage, whether there's mold, if anyone died in
it, how many bedrooms it has, does the layout work for you, how the 
foundation is, whether there's lead paint, etc. With this information 
you can make a better decision re: whether/how to move forward with the 
sale.

Hopefully no one died in your dataset, but like houses on on the 
market datasets can contain unpleasant surprises. These surprises have 
the potential to confuse and cloud your analysis unless taken care of. 
Any conclusions you make based on "unclean" data are suspect. I'll be 
writing a series of posts discussing how to deal with a number 
of these issues. As they come out I'll link to each new topic in this post, 
or you can check out the feed to find the topic relevant to your work.

For this week, something easy-peasy: The two ways that data can be unclean.
Data can be dirty. Data can be messy. Data can also be dirty AND messy; it's 
not at all uncommon. So what's the difference?

Dirty data has issues with quality. Data might be inaccurate, missing, 
duplicated, or the wrong type (Think mud on your bedsheets or an apple
core on your dresser).

Messy data has structural issues, it's untidy, poorly organized (Think
pants on the floor and books in the shower).

See you next week, when we'll dive into the details on dirty vs. messy
data!
