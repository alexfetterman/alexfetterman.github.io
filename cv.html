Summary
Curious, adaptable, creative, and energetic critical thinker with six years of professional experience teaching math. My time in education made clear the need for targeted analysis of data with the goal of effecting system-wide positive change. I want to collaborate with people dedicated to using data to do this in their communities and the world at large, and I plan to be part of the exciting future of machine and deep learning.

Strengths
Convey technical information to non-experts: Students begin calculus all over the readiness spectrum. I learned to meet them where they were and to get creative in my approach.
Collaborate and connect: Effective teaching requires fostering relationships and problem solving with students, parents, and teachers. I'm proud of my ability to do this.
Question the obvious: Asking questions about the status-quo helps me think outside of the box and see pathways to innovative solutions.
Prioritize and organize: Everything is urgent in a school setting. I prioritized effectively, using highly organized digital and physical spaces to manage 120+ students.
