<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
I am a curious, adaptable, creative, and energetic critical 
thinker with six years of professional experience teaching

analysis of data with the goal of effecting system-wide 
positive change. I want to collaborate with people dedicated 
to using data to do this in their communities and the world 
at large, and I plan to be part of the exciting future of 
machine and deep learning.
